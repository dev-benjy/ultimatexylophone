# ultimatexylophone
READ ME FIRST!!!!


It took me a while to figure out how to leave out cache folders out of unity because i couldn't get git lfs to work.
So here is a working prototype of the ultimate xylophone project.
It has a ton of functionality with Learn and Play Directly from your favorite videos on YouTube, Pitch Control, 
Layout Customizations, Music Contests, A New & Unique Looping System with Record i am working on.
There are a few credits i have to give so bear with me while i update those.
1. The credits for the sound samples (mentioned in - app)
2. credits for the Andrid Audio Bypass using soundpool.

PLEASE DOWNLOAD THE APK NAMED "ULTIMATE_XYLO_1.0.apk" This app is developed for android only.
